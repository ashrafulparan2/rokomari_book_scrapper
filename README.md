# rokomari_scrapper
Here I have created a <b>Web Scrapper</b> using <b>BeautifulSoup4</b> package of python. This scrapper will take - "Name of the Publisher" (for example: "Agami") from User as input and will bring all the informations (Book Title, Author, Publisher, ISBN Number, Edition, Country, Language, Summary) of all the books of that publication from rokomari.com. Then it will create a .csv file of that books and their information and will save the file in the same directiory where the script.py is kept.

To use this scrapper, 
- clone this repository
- create a python virtual environment using the requirement.txt file
- activate that environment
- run script.py in that environment 
- type any publisher name (for example: Agami)

Then wait a little, it will scrap the data from <b>Rokomari</b> website.
